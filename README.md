Summary of Data Analysis

Starting from 15 March 2020, most countries are showing exponential rise in number of COVID-19 reported cases. 

Key drivers of COVID-19 spread/elimination: 
  (a) Tourism/Travel score, (b) Diagnostic Tests/Million of Population, 
  (c) Health Care and Awareness Score,  and (d) Human Freedom Score. 

Temperature and Humidity can possibly help improve immune system of people. 
   But, as per analysis, it is estimated to reduce # of COVID cases about 5-10% only. 


Key recommendations for eliminating, or reducing COVID cases. 

(a) Minimum 2000 diagnostic tests/million population in a country. 
(b) Improved social distancing, and reduce travels. 
(c) Improved health care and awareness for people. 
     Rich Economic Score â‰  Best Health Care and Awareness. 

Note: Above recommendation are based on data analysis in this project report. 
           On top of that all citizens must follow guidance of CDC, and WHO.
